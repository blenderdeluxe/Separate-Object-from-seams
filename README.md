# Separate Object from seams

- Select the object
- Go to Edit Mode
- Deselect all
- Run Script!

You need run the script many times, at when you separate manually all seams islands :).

In the script I specify index face 4, for select a one face before select all island (Ctrl+L)

```
face[4]
```

you can change this index manually in the script if you need.
